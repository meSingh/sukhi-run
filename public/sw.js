/**
 * Keeps the app working with no connection.
 *
 * This app is on the website only, for now, and on the web "works with no
 * internet" has to be arranged. It matters, because a child may well have
 * added this to a home screen on a tablet that spends its life in aeroplane
 * mode.
 *
 * ## What it does, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * Two strategies, chosen by what the file is:
 *
 *   the page      network first, cache as a fallback. The page is the one
 *                 thing that is not content-addressed, so asking the network
 *                 first is how a new version ever arrives. If the network is
 *                 not there, yesterday's page is a great deal better than an
 *                 error.
 *   everything    cache first. Vite puts a hash of the contents in each
 *   else          filename, so a given URL can only ever mean one file and
 *                 there is nothing to revalidate. Icons and the manifest are
 *                 not hashed, but they change about once a year.
 *
 * It caches only this app's own files, same origin and inside its own scope.
 * Nothing here talks to anywhere else, and a service worker that cached third
 * party responses would be a way for it to start.
 *
 * Nothing a child does goes near this: the only thing the run keeps is a
 * grown-up's scare setting, in localStorage, which this does not touch.

/**
 * The shell, as far as it can be known without the build writing this file.
 * The hashed script and stylesheet are not listed because their names change
 * every build; they arrive in the cache on first visit instead, which is one
 * load earlier than it needs to be for anyone who installs before going
 * offline.
